      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Faheem Iqbal, a passionate photographer from Shopian, Kashmir. My love for nature and storytelling through 
        visuals inspired me to capture the beauty of our world — one frame at a time. 
        I specialize in nature and street photography, and my work reflects the essence of everyday life and untouched landscapes. 
        Let’s connect and explore creativity together!

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, my passion for photography has been recognized on both local 
          and global platforms. I'm proud to have received <strong>35 photography awards</strong> 
          across various categories including nature, street, and conceptual photography and got into the list of <strong>Top 14%</strong> photographers all across the globe. 
          These awards reflect my dedication to capturing authentic moments and stories through the lens.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the proudest moments in my journey was when my photo, captured on a Google Pixel phone, 
          was <strong>recognized by Google</strong> and appreciated by their official Instagram handles. 
          Their acknowledgment reaffirmed my belief that powerful storytelling can emerge from simple, 
          everyday moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work has also been appreciated by multiple online photography communities and has been published in local photo journals. I continue to explore new techniques and themes while staying rooted in the raw beauty of Kashmir and the everyday lives of people around me.
